# Getting Started with User-Service

1. Remember to move the env file (from Canvas) created for user service into ./user-services

2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies

3. Run `npx prisma generate`

4. Run `npm start` to start the service.

## Congratulations! you have now set up your micro-service locally!

### Testing

To test the user-service, send REST api calls to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`.
This can be done through POSTMAN or the frontend, when completed.
